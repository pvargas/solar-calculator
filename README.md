Code snippets were taken from the Google Maps API [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/), and also from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12004550/how-to-delete-all-the-shape-after-draw/12006751), and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10298549/how-i-get-coordinates-with-drawing).

I originally setup a Flask backend thinking it would be useful (it wasn't), all it does is serve the frontend.
